# Temple Bells

Anand is then greeted by Ram, his cousin whom he's meeting after a long time. Ram, aka Ramanathan, is taking care of his farming business and runs some excellent school programs in the village. Ram is known for his witty problem-solving skills around the town, giving unconventional answers based on his internet exposure. 

Anand surprised that ram hasn’t changed a bit since his last meeting, is taking stock of ram’s life. 

“Interesting! Never though data can do wonders in the village.” Anand said while sipping his favorite coffee. 

“You have no idea, dude. My Farm uses state-of-the-art infrastructure to run. The best thing is that it's sustainable and cheap. People here never listen to me. Now everyone wants returns like me, but no one supports new tech. Anyways, get ready, we must go out. I'll shut off the motor pump quickly and return in 30 minutes. Be ready!” – Ram started his old two-wheeler.

“Didn’t you say you have state of the art infra? Doesn't the pump shut itself off? “- Anand asked.

“Yeah, it does! But until those little chimps get out of the water, the motor won't shut. It takes a click of a button, but the remaining 29 minutes and 30 seconds are to convince those little ones to get out and go home before they fall sick.” Ram zooms out with that old vehicle. 

Meanwhile, Anand heard bells ringing from a distance; assuming it was one of the daily temple rituals, Anand rushed to get ready before Ram was back.
